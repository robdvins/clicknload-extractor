<p align="center">This is a tiny script in Node to extract links from Click'n'Load buttons.</p>

## What are Click'n'Load buttons?

> Click'n'Load can be used to add one, or more links to **JDownloader** or **Mipony** from some 🏴‍☠️ sites very easily. One click sends the links. This makes things very comfortable for the users. To accept links, **JDownloader** and **Mipony** runs a little WebServer on `localhost`. A `POST` Request to http://localhost:9666 can add links and passwords.

## Why this script?

Because some people don't like or can't use [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/) or [Mipony](https://www.mipony.net/en/) to manage their downloads. 🤪

## Usage

Please note that you need to have **Node.js installed** and **not have JDownloader or Mipony running**.

1. Download the script and save it wherever you want.
2. Open the terminal and run it.

```sh
node clicknload-server.js
```

3. Happy download! 😉
